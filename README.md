# FastAPI Calculator with Secure User Auth, Calculation Models & CRUD Logic

A production-ready FastAPI application featuring a fully functional interactive calculator and a secure user authentication system backed by PostgreSQL. The project includes automated CI/CD pipelines, comprehensive testing, and containerization.

## Features

* **Calculator BREAD API:** Complete endpoints to Browse, Read, Edit, Add, and Delete mathematical operations, with all data securely saved to the database using a structured Calculation model.
* **Modular Architecture:** Organized codebase utilizing FastAPI APIRouter to cleanly separate user authentication routes from calculation logic.
* **Robust Data Validation:** Strict input validation utilizing Pydantic schemas to catch errors (like division by zero or invalid data types) before they ever reach the database or business logic.
* **Scalable Logic:** Implements the Factory Design Pattern to cleanly decouple the mathematical calculation logic from the API routing and database layers.
* **Secure User Management:** User registration and login endpoints with secure password hashing using passlib and bcrypt, featuring foreign-key relationships linking users to their calculation history.
* **PostgreSQL Integration:** Fully integrated relational database setup using SQLAlchemy ORM.
* **Comprehensive Testing:** Unit, integration, and End-to-End (E2E) testing using pytest and playwright.
* **Automated CI/CD:** GitHub Actions pipeline configured for testing, security scanning (Bandit), and automated deployment to Docker Hub.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
* **Python 3.11+**
* **Docker Desktop** (for running the local PostgreSQL database)
* **Git**

## Local Development Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Aniket-NJIT/calculator_module12.git
cd calculator_module12
```
### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
playwright install chromium  # Required for E2E UI testing
```

### 4. Start the Database (Docker Compose)
```bash
docker compose up -d
```
Access pgAdmin at http://localhost:5050 (Login: `admin@admin.com` / Password: admin).

Once connected to pgAdmin, create two databases:
1. calculator_db (For the main application)
2. test_calculator_db (For local testing)


### 5. Run the Application
```bash
python -m uvicorn main:app --reload
```
- Frontend UI: http://127.0.0.1:8000/
- Interactive API Docs (Swagger): http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

### 6. Run Tests Locally
```bash
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/test_calculator_db" TEST_DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/test_calculator_db" pytest
```
The test suite covers:

- test_main.py: Validates core application startup and root route responses.

- test_operations.py: Unit tests for the core mathematical functions.

- test_users.py: Integration tests for the users router, including user registration, duplicate email constraints, and secure login credential verification.

- test_calculations.py: Unit and integration tests for the calculations router, validating the Calculation model, the factory pattern logic, strict Pydantic schemas, and the full BREAD (Browse, Read, Edit, Add, Delete) endpoint lifecycle.

- test_e2e.py: End-to-End Playwright tests that spin up a headless browser to click through the frontend UI and verify visual outputs.

### Docker Hub & Deployment
This project is fully containerized and automatically built and pushed to Docker Hub upon every successful merge to the main branch via GitHub Actions.

View the docker hub repository at: https://hub.docker.com/r/akhalate/calculator-backend

You can pull the latest built image directly from Docker Hub to run the application anywhere:
```bash
docker pull akhalate/calculator-backend
```

To run the containerized application locally (Note: You must pass in your database credentials):
```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 -e DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:postgres@host.docker.internal:5432/calculator_db" akhalate/calculator-backend:latest
```

### CI/CD Pipeline Architecture
The `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` file dictates the automated workflow:
1. Test Job: Spins up a fresh PostgreSQL service container, installs dependencies, and runs the full pytest suite.
2. Security Job: Runs bandit to scan the codebase for known vulnerabilities.
3. Deploy Job: Authenticates with Docker Hub and pushes the newly built image, tagged as latest.
